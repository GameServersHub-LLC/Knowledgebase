By shutting down the server, you ensure that all changes are properly loaded and applied when you restart it.</li></ul></li><li><p>Security:</p><ul><li>Editing files on a running server can expose vulnerabilities or create security risks. By shutting down the server, you minimize the window of opportunity for any potential security issues.</li></ul></li><li><p>Backup Opportunity:</p><ul><li>Shutting down the server gives you a chance to back up the current state of the game files before making changes, providing a fallback option if something goes wrong.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>To ensure a smooth and error-free update process, it&#39;s best to always stop the server, make your edits, and then restart it.</strong></p></div>`);
