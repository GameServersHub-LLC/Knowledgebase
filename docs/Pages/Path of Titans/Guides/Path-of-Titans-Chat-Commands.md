# Chat Commands

To use these commands, simply log into your server and open the text chat in-game. Type your command and hit **"Enter"** to execute the command. Text commands can also be used when in Spectator Mode.

::: tip
Optional parameters can be added anywhere inside the command and will change the way the command works.
::: details
One Example is `/teleport` - By default, it teleports safely, making sure the player is on ground and not inside anything. But the keyword `unsafe` will stop the teleport from checking for a safe location.
:::

When creating player roles, the permission to allow any command is the name of the command unless otherwise stated, for example, `/bring` relies on the "teleport" permission, so you must allow that permission in order for a role to use `/bring`.

## General Command
