# Path of Titans Replay Recordings

::: danger
The Replay Tool is not yet released on mobile platforms (iOS and Android).
:::

You can use Replay Recordings to help moderate your server. If a player claims they were unfairly killed, saw a rulebreaker, or otherwise wants to report something, you can ask them for Replay Recording evidence.

Replays will record the gameplay of all players within render distance of the player recording the replay. It will show nametags, growth stages, grouped players, and more. With this information, you can make judgements on player behaviour without needing active moderators to watch all the time.

There are two aspects to Replay Recordings: Client Side and Server Side recordings.
